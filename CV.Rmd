## SUMMARY

I am a PhD candidate at Carleton University specializing in quantitative ecological conservation. My work focuses on using existing data, and in particular community science data, to conduct broad-scale conservation research. I have a strong background in spatial statistics, decision science, literature review and big data analysis. My network of collaborators includes scientists from government (Environment and Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Service), non-governmental organizations (The Nature Conservancy and Nature Conservancy Canada), and other academic institutions (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, The University of Queensland, and The University of British Columbia).
