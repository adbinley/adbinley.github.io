**Research**

My [work](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=CrX15nAAAAAJ&hl=en) focuses on integrating existing data, particularly participatory science data, to conduct broad-scale conservation research. I have a strong background in spatial statistics, decision science, data integration, literature review and big data analysis, and my research spans local, hemispheric and global scales. My lab at the University of Manitoba will focus primarily on improving conservation planning in anthropogenically-modified spaces. Many of my current projects examine balancing the needs of grassland birds and agriculture in grassland habitats, and I collaborate extensively with NGO's and the federal government.

**Background**

I completed my PhD at Carleton University in 2023 specializing in quantitative biodiversity conservation. The aim of my thesis research was to examine how advances in the use and integration of big datasets are crucial for conducting more effective conservation research and improving management decisions and outcomes. Prior to my appointment at the University of Manitoba, I was a Rose Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/), where I worked on research supporting the development of dynamic conservation programs aimed at support biodiversity at the times and locations that are most critical to their survival.
